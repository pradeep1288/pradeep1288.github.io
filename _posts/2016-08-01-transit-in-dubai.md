excerpt: Itinerary ideas for a 24hr layover in Dubai airport
---
What do you do when you have a layover in Dubai, which is sufficiently long (23 hours in my case)? Get a transit visa and go around Dubai. This post will give you itinerary ideas if you decide to spend at-least a day in Dubai.

## How do I get a Visa?
I hold an Indian Passport and most Indian passport holders need to get a visa before they visit any country.
First, in order to get a transit visa you need to have a flight reservation with either Emirates or Qantas.
There are links available within the airlineâ€™s website on booking your Dubai transit visa.
Make sure you apply for your visa at-least 4 days prior to your arrival in Dubai, else the system would not allow you to apply for a visa.
The visa cost is ~73$ for a 96 hour visa. If you need express service, add another 20$ to the cost.
I used express service as I applied very late. You will receive your visa via email.
You can either have a copy of the visa on your phone or take a printout for immigration at Dubai Airport.

## What about my bags?
I had most of my bags checked in, so I had just a backpack. If you do have a carry on bag with you, there are locker facilities available at the Dubai airport and the prices are affordable.
Please check the Dubai [airport](http://www.dubaiairports.ae) website for more details for locker facilities.
