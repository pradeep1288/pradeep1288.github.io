I live in San Jose, California and often I am on the lookout for quick weekend getaways. Portland is one, if you find cheaper flight deals. Usually Alaska Airlines has some nice deals throughout the year. You can subscribe to those on the Alaska Airlines website and keep a lookout for deals in your inbox. I travelled to Portland, Oregon with a friend of mine for the weekend as we got really cheap flights for 290$ round trip for both of us. This post will give you itinerary ideas if you decide to visit Portland for a weekend.

We arrived at Portaland on a Saturday morning around 8am from San Jose. We left on Sunday around 8PM from Portland.
